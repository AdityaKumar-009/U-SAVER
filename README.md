# U-Saver: YouTube Video Downloader

U-Saver (derived from YouTube Video Saver) is a Python-based YouTube Video Downloader application built using the tkinter library for the user interface. It allows users to easily download YouTube videos by providing a video URL, downloading videos using keywords, or even through voice recognition. The app features different themes for user interface with both light and dark modes.

## Features

- **YouTube URL Video Download**: Users can input a YouTube video URL into the Entry Box and download the video by clicking the "Download" button.

- **AI Video Download**: Users can type a keyword in the second entry box and use the "AI Button" to download the first YouTube video related to the search keyword.

- **Voice Recognition**: U-Saver supports voice recognition, allowing users to initiate video downloads by speaking the keyword into their microphone.

- **Themed UI**: The app offers custom themes, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes to suit their preferences.

- **Version 2.0 Enhancements**:
  - **Progress Bar**: U-Saver now displays a progress bar during video downloads, depicting the file size and download progress.
  - **Multiple Resolutions**: Users can choose from various resolutions (e.g., 144p, 360p, 720p) or even download the video as an MP3 audio file.
  - **Video Thumbnail**: The app now displays a video thumbnail to give users a preview of the content.
  - **Download Confirmation Popup**: Before downloading a video, a confirmation popup will appear, allowing users to confirm or cancel the download.
